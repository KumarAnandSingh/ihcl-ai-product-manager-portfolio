### **Step-by-Step AI Processing:**

#### **Step 1: Classification**
**What You See:** `🔄 🔍 Analyzing incident context...`  
**Result:** `✅ Classification: Access Violation (85-95% confidence)`

**Script:** *"First, the AI analyzes the incident context and classifies it. 85-95% confidence means the AI is highly certain this is an access violation, not a different type of security incident."*

#### **Step 2: Priority Assessment**  
**What You See:** `🔄 📊 Assessing priority level...`  
**Result:** `✅ Priority: HIGH (Risk Score: 7/10)`

**Script:** *"The AI evaluates multiple factors - guest status (Gold member), time of day, potential impact - and assigns a risk score. 7/10 puts this at HIGH priority because of the guest's loyalty status."*

#### **Step 3: Policy Check**
**What You See:** `🔄 📋 Checking hotel policies and compliance...`  
**Result:** `✅ Policy Compliance: COMPLIANT - Guest Access Policy, Checkout Procedures, Security Protocols`

**Script:** *"The system checks this incident against IHCL's specific policies. It knows your guest access policy, checkout procedures, and security protocols."*

#### **Step 4: Guest Context**
**What You See:** `🔄 👤 Looking up guest profile and history...`  
**Result:** `✅ Guest Context: Gold member, 6 stays`

**Script:** *"This is where hospitality intelligence matters. The AI looks up the guest's profile - Gold member with 6 previous stays - which influences how we handle the situation."*

#### **Step 5: Compliance Validation**
**What You See:** `🔄 🛡️ Validating regulatory compliance...`  
**Result:** `✅ Compliance Check: COMPLIANT - DPDP, PCI DSS, GDPR validated`

**Script:** *"Every action is validated against regulatory requirements. DPDP for data handling, PCI DSS for payment data, GDPR for EU guests."*

#### **Step 6: Response Planning**
**What You See:** `🔄 📝 Generating response plan...`  
**Result:** `✅ Response Plan: Deny access, notify guest, offer assistance - Immediate action required`

**Script:** *"The AI generates a specific response plan: deny access for security, but immediately notify the guest and offer assistance - protecting both security and guest experience."*

#### **Step 7: Human-in-the-Loop**
**What You See:** 
```
⚠️  HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED - HIGH priority incident
🔄 Escalating to security manager for approval...
✅ Human approval received - proceeding with automated response
```

**Script:** *"Because this is HIGH priority involving a valued guest, the system requires human approval. This human-in-the-loop gate ensures critical decisions aren't made without oversight."*

#### **Step 8: Execution**
**What You See:** `🔄 🚀 Executing response plan...`  
**Result:** `✅ Execution: SUCCESS - Security team notified, Guest services alerted, Incident logged, Follow-up scheduled`
